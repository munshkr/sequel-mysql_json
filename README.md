# Sequel::MysqlJson

Sequel extension and plugin that adds better support for MySQL JSON columns and
functions (added first on MySQL 5.7.8).

### `mysql_json` plugin

`mysql_json` detects MySQL json columns on models and automatically adds column
accessors that deserializes JSON values. Uses Sequel's builtin Serialization
plugin for this purpose.

### `mysql_json_op` extension

`mysql_json_op` extension adds support to Sequel's DSL to make it easier to
call MySQL JSON functions and operators.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sequel-mysql_json'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sequel-mysql_json


## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
